■ Record of "Yaneura Daijoseki" generation
 
【Effect】
Yaneura Daijoseki is a deep exploration that takes a long time using YaneuraOu.
This is a project aimed at developing new joseki and maintaining conventional joseki.
 
The book itself generated by this project follows the YaneuraOu book format 2016.
We will publish it in a form that anyone can use.
 
 
Target game record = record1.sfen (2ch game record) + α
 
・ 1st to 5th moves MultiPV 10, depth 32 → Completed
・ 6th move MultiPV 10, depth 28 → Completed
・ 6th move MultiPV 10, depth 32 → Left unattended: It takes about 10 days with 20 cores.
・ 7th to 8th moves MultiPV 10, depth 24 → Completed
・ 7th to 8th moves MultiPV 10, depth 28 → Left unattended: It takes about 2 days with 20 cores.
・ 9th to 16th moves MultiPV 10, depth 24 → Completed
・ 9th to 16th moves MultiPV 10, depth 28 → Left unattended: It takes about 20 days with 20 cores.
・ 17th to 32nd moves MultiPV 5, depth 18 → Completed
・ 17th-18th move MultiPV 10, depth 28 → Left unattended: It takes about 20 days with 20 cores.
 
Future plans.
 
1) I want something that has been searched with a depth of 32 up to the 16th move.
2) I want to improve the evaluation function and then regenerate it.
3) I want to make a search with a depth of 32 for a fixed track of specific software such as craftsmanship and Apery.
4) I want something that is searched at depth 32 for the progress of the game record of the upper software of floodgate.
